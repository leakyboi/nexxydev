### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Im Drafti.sh, aka nexxydev. A 13 y/o programmer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DraftishCore, a minecraft server core based off of the leaked AquaCore 4.5 SRC (GOD that project is LOOONG dead LMFAOO)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, JavaScript, and attempting C/C#
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'll add my telegram at some point. (probably never will to be honest with ya, i dont wanna give my number out.)
- âš¡ Fun question: If you kill yourself, is it natural selection

(As per shaysons github issue, a day ago i brought a domain and chucked a simple GRAV site on it. https://draftish.xyz btw :)
